# Empirical Rounding

In scientific writing, empirical numbers should be rounded according to their estimated precision.
This example contains a Matlab/Octave function which rounds and formats a number according to its estimated measurement deviation.
It has been ported from an [R package][mpformatr] that I created a few years ago for my thesis writing.
