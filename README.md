# Training Materials

This repo contains the teaching materials for a training on integrating version control with Git into the research workflow.
The training was conducted for the members of the CRC 135 and their co-workers as part of the NOWA project.

## Contents

The training is divided into two sessions:

### Concepts of version control and basic workflows

In this session, the participants familiarize themselves with version control as a working method and get the opportunity to practice the basic Git workflows.
They will be able to:

- Explore existing Git repositories, browse the version history, compare versions, extract data from older versions
- Edit data in a repo and add new versions,, make use of Git's features for parallel working contexts
- Decide if Git is suitable for their needs

### Project customization and Gitlab

In this session, the scope extends to collaboration on Gitlab projects. These topics are covered:

- Connecting Git repos with Gitlab and uploading work for backup
- Customizing Git repos for the project content
- Sharing Gitlab projects with co-workers for review
- Collaborating with co-workers on a shared Gitlab project

## Materials

- The Reveal.js presentation and the PDF handout in the _build_ directory cover the topics of both sessions.
- Handout and presentations are built with R Markdown from the files in the _source_ directory.
- The _examples_ directory contains several miniature projects of different content types.
  They are used for the exercises.
- _notes.md_ contains content that isn't yet integrated into the slides and handout.
