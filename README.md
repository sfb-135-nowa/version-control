This repo contains the source files for the written version of a course on integrating version control with Git into the research workflow.
The course was conducted for the members of the CRC 135 and their co-workers as part of the NOWA project.
The written version mainly consists of a living online manuscript which fulfills the role of a traditional handout, and a presentation.
