# Workflow

After learning to explore existing git repos, being productive with git is the next objective.
This chapter describes the workflow of integrating your changes into a new or existing project.

## Setup

Before you create your first commits, you have to configure a few settings:

Commit identity
: Your name and email address you want to be associated with your commits

Editor
: The text editor that should be opened when Git asks you for text input, e.g., commit messages.

Default branch
: The default name of a repo's primary branch

Git has a subcommand named `git config` which is used to customize Git's behavior on your local machine via settings.
There are many settings, and a setting can be configured for a single repo,
or as a (global) user default which is used for every repo where this setting isn't configured.
Here we will just set some user default settings.
Config settings are never persisted to the history or shared with collaborators, because they customize your working environment.
Git Tower doesn't provide a full interface to the config settings, and you partially need the command line.

```bash
# Display full user config
git config --global -l
# Display local repo config with merged global config
git config -l
```

### Commit identity

This identity is persisted into each of your commits and visible for everyone who can see your commits, thus it should be properly set.
It's just descriptive metadata, Git itself doesn't verify your email.
The actual identity data becomes more critical in conjunction with hosting platforms like Github or Gitlab,
because the platforms offer more security features and use the email to attribute your commits to your platform account.
Github provides [anonymized email addresses][github-commit-email] for users who don't want to expose their personal email.

In Git Tower, you can configure your user name and email via Preferences -> Git Config.
As a convenience feature provided by Git Tower, you can also store multiple identities under Preferences -> User Profiles, e.g., for work and private commits.
On the command line, use these commands to configure your identity:

```bash
# Please replace the identity values with your identity
git config --global user.name "Tamara Cook, M.Sc."
git config --global user.email tamara.cook@uni-marburg.de
# To display the current values, execute without second argument
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

### Editor

Git needs the program path of your preferred text editor.
When Git asks for text input, it opens this editor in a special mode where you can enter text,
and Git waits until you confirm your input by saving and closing the document.
In Git Tower, this setting will rarely be used.
If you'd never use the command line, you could skip this step, but it is recommended as a precaution.
Please configure one of the editors listed [in this appendix of Git Pro][editor-config] (table 4).

### Default branch

When a new repo is initialized, Git creates a primary branch as a starting point to work with immediately.
This branch often represents the current stable version of the project and is set as HEAD on hosting platforms like Gitlab or Github.
Historically, the default name of this primary branch has been “master”, but Git has added a config setting to customize this name.
A cultural change has occurred in the tech community which considers the master/slave terminology in today's technical applications as inappropriate, antiquated, and offensive,
and thus strives to replace these terms with more neutral ones in technical speech.
Git and platforms like Gitlab and Github support this movement and have chosen “main” as the new default branch name.
The migration process is inevitable but still in progress, that's why explicitly configuring the default branch is part of the first git setup for the time being.

```bash
# Create new repos with a primary branch called main
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
