# Welcome {-}

This book serves as the handout and written version of a course about integrating version control with git into the research workflow
that was created for the members of the CRC 135 and their co-workers as part of the NOWA project.
The course is divided into two sessions:

1. Concepts of version control and basic workflows
2. Project customization and collaboration
