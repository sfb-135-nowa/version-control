# Practice: History

Make sure you have cloned and opened the course repo in Git Tower.
The practice questions in this chapter can be answered from the History and branches view.
You could also browse the repo on Github which is also a common strategy for pure history inspection.
If you want to use the command line, some exercises can be a bit more challenging to solve.

## Exploring commits and their file changes

In Git Tower, you can use the filter field and the file context menu for subsetting the history by commit or file/folder.
On the command line, `git log` with some additional options is sufficient.

- How many commits changed the _README.md_ file in the repo's root folder?
- Which files have been affected by the `0d45a0081fe1db38fd4964a23ba4b4bfcec4987b` commit?
- Which is the newest commit of the `origin/example_mirror_duet` branch?

## Exploring commits and their associated project state

Please select the `origin/example_mirror_duet` branch.
The rest of this chapter will refer to this branch.

Git Tower lets you view the file list next to the commits as changeset or as tree.
In the last section, only the changesets were needed.
Please try to make use of both views to complete the exercises in this section.

- How many files are contained in the _examples/mirror-duet_ folder of the newest branch commit?
  Select an older commit in the branch, and observe how the folder changes.
- Please have a look into the readme file to get a quick overview of the example project.
- Please find the commit where the example folder has been added.
- In order to get a more visual impression of the example project's development,
  please open the PDF document in some of the commits from old to newest.
  You could also open the Lilypond source file or try to play the midi file, if you prefer those.

## Interpreting file content changes

Until now, you were exploring the history on commit and file level.
In this section, you have to answer some questions about file content changes by reading the diff.

- Can you verbalize from the diff what I had to do in the _mirror-duet.ly_ file in order to bring the duet into line with the edition by Schott Music?
- When I added the music for the 2nd violin, I added an additional fix to the score environment almost at the end of the file. Can you identify it?
- In the “Clean source file” commit of the branch I did some housekeeping on the source file where the actual content didn't change anymore.
  Can you verbalize what I did? Why does the diff contain so many removed and added lines of music, although the meaning didn't change?
- In this example project, I have added the output files to each commit, so you can view the differences without having to install the lilypond compiler.
  A rule of thumb is not to commit build artefacts because they can be reclaimed, but it can be reasonable to keep them in version control.
  Please think about pros and cons for committing artefacts
